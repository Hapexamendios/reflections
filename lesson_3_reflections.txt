When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to use a remote repository in several situations. First, if you are 
working on more than just one machine. This way, you're not being forced to move
files back and forth between them. Second, if multiple people are working on a 
project together, a remote repository is likely necessary to avoid needing to 
manually pass files back and forth between computers and having an ever increasing
number of branches. Finally, a remote repository may be helpful in that it could
make it easy to pull files from what is essentially a remote host onto servers
that may run it, rather than having to use some other file transfer method.
