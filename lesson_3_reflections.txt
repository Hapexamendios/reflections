When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to use a remote repository in several situations. First, if you are 
working on more than just one machine. This way, you're not being forced to move
files back and forth between them. Second, if multiple people are working on a 
project together, a remote repository is likely necessary to avoid needing to 
manually pass files back and forth between computers and having an ever increasing
number of branches. Finally, a remote repository may be helpful in that it could
make it easy to pull files from what is essentially a remote host onto servers
that may run it, rather than having to use some other file transfer method.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Always pulling changes manually will help to ensure that changes made on a remote
repo, such as those made by other people working on the same project, will not
overwrite what you may be working on at a given moment.
