What happens when you initialize a repo? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repo creates a hidden .git folder, containing the metadata
that allows it to track changes in files, allowing version control. You need
to do it so that the hidden folder that tracks all this meta data is created.

How is the staging area different than the working directory and the repo?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different in that it is a place where we can bundle 
together groups of files for a commit, and allow us to selectively commit 
changed files rather than being forced to commit all changes at once. The value
is in this selective commitment.
